This paper presents a coordinate-free trajectory tracking control design for the
nonlinear dynamics of a variable pitch quadrotor. Unlike conventional quadrotors, the rotor
thrust is varied by changing its blade pitch angle as opposed to its RPM. It has been shown
that such an actuation mechanism has a very high control bandwidth and is capable of producing
negative thrust, which facilitates aggressive trajectory tracking. However, the control allocation
in the actuator for generating the commanded thrust and torque is not a static, linear relation,
but is nonlinear and dynamic. Further, transient disturbances are present due to rapid variations
in aerodynamic load on the rotor dynamics while varying the blade pitch angle. The proposed
control law consists of a robust attitude controller augmented with a saturated thrust-feedback
position controller. The control law is shown to almost-globally stabilize the tracking errors on
SE(3) at an exponential rate
