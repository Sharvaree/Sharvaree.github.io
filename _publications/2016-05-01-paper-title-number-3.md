excerpt: 'This is my Master's thesis submitted as part of Integrated BS-MS at IISER Pune. 
Black Holes in Five Dimensions - Higher dimensional Gravity is important to understand Gravity in general.
The Uniqueness of Black Holes is not followed in higher dimensions as it does in four dimensions. This thesis dives deep into the famous five dimensional spherical black hole solution given by Myers and Perry and a Black ring solution for Einstein's equations in five dimensions.
The Black Ring solution given by Emparan and Reall termed Black Rings, are objects with horizons with a unique topology S1 x S2.
The general Black ring solution, either give a thin  or thick Black ring solution depeneding on the mass. This leads to breaking of uniqueness theorems and we can show how the uniqueness theorems valid in fours dimensions are not valid in d >= 5.'
