This paper addresses the problem of designing a
trajectory tracking control law for a quadrotor UAV, subsequent
to complete failure of a single rotor. The control design problem
considers the reduced state space which excludes the angular velocity
and orientation about the vertical body axis. The proposed
controller enables the quadrotor to track the orientation of this
axis, and consequently any prescribed position trajectory using
only three rotors. The control design is carried out in two stages.
First, in order to track the reduced attitude dynamics, a geometric
controller with two input torques is designed on the Lie-Group
SO(3). This is then extended to SE(3) by designing a saturation
based feedback law, in order to track the center of mass position
with bounded thrust. The control law for the complete dynamics
achieves exponential tracking for all initial conditions lying in an
open-dense subset. The novelty of the geometric control design is
in its ability to effectively execute aggressive, global maneuvers
despite complete loss of a rotor. Numerical simulations on models
of a variable pitch and a conventional quadrotor have been
presented to
