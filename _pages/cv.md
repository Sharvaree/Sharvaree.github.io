Research experience
======
* August 2019 - April 2020: Research Assistant, University of Utah, UT
  * Supervisor: Dr. Hari Sundar
  * Worked on designing an apparent event horizon solver for Schwarzschild Blackhole and solving Einstein's        equation on a discretized sphere and used an adaptive grid to reduce computation time.
  * Worked on High Performance Computing clusters and extensively coded in C++ using Message Passing Interfae (MPI)

* August 2018 - April 2019: Research Assistant, University of Utah, UT
  * Supervisor: Dr. Aditya Bhaskara
  * Developed an approximation algorithm, a variant of K-means and K-center algorithm, which is robust in
 presence of outliers.
  * Gave theoretical guarantees on the results along with experimental evidence (Python) of robustness.

* August 2016 - April 2017: Research Assistant, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore
  * Supervisor: Dr. Soumyendu Raha
  * Designed and implemented geometric control for a Variable pitch Quadcopter with rotor failure.
  * Developed and implemented stable orbit estimation using Kalman filter and extended Kalman filter.
